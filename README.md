# Land-Registry-System
The proposed system will enable secure and transparent land transactions by facilitating smart
contract-based agreements between buyers and sellers. This will streamline the land transaction
process and reduce the need for intermediaries, such as lawyers and brokers, thereby reducing
transaction costs and improving efficiency

## Purpose of the Project
The purpose of the Land Documentation and Registry system using Blockchain
technology is to provide a secure and transparent way to store land ownership records
and transactions. By using blockchain technology, land registry systems can be made
more efficient, secure and cost-effective

## Project Objective
1. To explore the benefits of using blockchain technology for Land Documentation and
Registry systems.
2.  To create more efficient, secure, and transparent Land Documentation and Registry
systems.
3. To overcome the inefficiencies, and errors and reduce the chances of fraud in the
traditional registry systems.
4. To integrate this system with existing land registration systems.
5. To design a user-friendly interface such that the system is accessible to all
stakeholders such as landowners, buyer and government officials.
